Detailed Course Schedule
------------------------

Each week the studio will be split into two parts: Discussion and a hands-on lab. We will begin with a check-in and a review of progress, followed by discussion of the assigned text for the week. After a short break, we'll switch to a hands-on lab. Lab activities will vary each week and depend on projects but include: Learning to use collaborative project tools; project sprints; testing; production of documentation; comparison / evaluation of competing solutions, and so on.
